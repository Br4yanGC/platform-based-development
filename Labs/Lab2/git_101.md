# Git 101 (very very basics)

## Requirements

`git` is included in the Ubuntu WSL that we are using. However, we will need to install the GitHub Cli for this session. Follow the installation instructions [in this guide](./gh_setup). 

## Create a repository in Github website

It's pretty intuitive but instructions are also available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

## Basic operations (using simple words)

- clone: Creates a copy of the repository in your computer. We are going to use the GitHub Cli for this lab.

`gh repo clone owner_github_id/repo_name`

- pull: Downloads the latest changes into your local computer

`git pull`

- status: View the actual status of the files (which ones were modified or added)

`git status`

- add: Records an instruction to add all the new files created so they are included when you send your changes to the remote repository.

`git add .`

- commit: Get your changes ready and attaches a message describing what has been done.

`git commit -am "A message"`

- push: Send the changes to the remote repository.

`git push`
