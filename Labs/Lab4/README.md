# Lab 4

## Before the lab

- Make sure to have Node installed in your computer using the following [guide](./nvm_setup.md).

- Make sure to install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

- Also, make sure to review the syntax of Javascript and the following [guide](./node_101.md) for NodeJS basics.

## During the lab

- We will follow the next [sample scenario](./chess_scenario.md).

- We will begin [creating a database](./chess_db.md) for them.

- We will [create a basic Web API](./api_101.md) that return the classic `Hello World` message.

- We will [make our API fetch data from a database](./node_102.md) so it can display the chess members from the database. This API can be used by any platform, for example a webpage, mobile app, university systems, etc...

- We will [create a Web Application](./webapp_101.md) that will list chess members in a table. The website will obtain the data from the API previously created.

## Code samples

Code developed during the lab can be found [here](./code_samples).
