## Node

We are going to use `nmv` to manage the different versions of NodeJS and NPM.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

Close and open your terminal.

We install the latest stableversion of Node:

```
nvm install --lts
```

You can check it installed correctly by doing:

```
node -v
npm -v
```
